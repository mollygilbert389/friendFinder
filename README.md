<h1> Friend Finder </h1>

This app was created using Bootstrap, HTML, api Routes and Express. Using a form and an algorithm users can take a survey and receive results based on our matching algorithm. Once the user clicks the submit button, a modal will appear with the results based on who else has taken this survey, and been added to the JSON file.
