## Description
This app was created using JavaScript, Bootstrap, Express and a matching algorithm to generate results. Using a form and a simple algorithm users can take a survey and receive results on who their newest friend should be. Once the user clicks the submit button, a modal will appear with the results based on other users who have taken this survey
